Question of ex3:

We would need to add/change/remove the following code in order to support multiplication:
    - Add the multiplication functionality in the interface.
    - Add the implementation: Need to add the symbols to the ORDERS list and also the newCalc function needs to be changed.
    - Need to set an onClickListener in both the MainActivity.
    - Need to add the view in the activity_main.xml layouts.
    - Need to add test cases to test the functionality.

On the calculator we need to run tests with the multiplication button:
    - Regular calculations to check that the math is right
    - Complex calculations to check that the math is right
    - Doing multiplication when no input was given
    - Multiplying by a negative number
    - Double the same order test
    - And more...

On the activity we need to run the following tests:
    - Check that when pressing the "x" button, then the right function was activated

On the app we need to run the following tests:
     - Calculations and check the output while using the "x" button.
     - Deleting the "x" after pressed, clearing etc.
